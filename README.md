# IterExam

This project contains several examples to show the effectiveness of our proposed iterative controller synthesis approach.
Most of these examples are created with some background in practice.
In the project, each folder contains an example consist of the iterative version of formal specifications and controllers for robots.
The experiments are conducted on LTLMoP toolkit which can be acquired at https://github.com/VerifiableRobotics/LTLMoP.
