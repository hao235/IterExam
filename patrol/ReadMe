This example is the same as the one in Section VI of our paper. 

r_A, r_B and r_C are three robots performing tasks in a facility. Intuitively speaking, r_A is responsible for emergency patrols, and will keep records when r_B sends observed information. r_B will do the normal patrols, and it wonâ€™t appear if r_A is patrolling. And the only function of r_C is to assist r_B in patrolling. d_B means it is consistent with the action d in of r_B, so a_A and c_B is defined in similar way.
